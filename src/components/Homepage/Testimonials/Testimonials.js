      " My working relationship and then friendship with Shodipo started in 2017. My first impression was that this guy has aspirations that are much larger than his local community. Since then we've worked together on multiple projects and programs where he has proved time and time again to go above and beyond for those around him. Recommendations alone do not shed light to the positive impact Shodipo can bring to an organization, community, and the developer landscape."

      " I started unStack with Shodipo because when it comes to building developer communities, it's in his DNA. I have enjoyed working with him in planning events that attracted many local and international speakers. His organizational skills are top-notch and I've enjoyed learning some skills from him which has helped me become better at planning and running developer community events. Shodipo is also an avid speaker who delivers great content with his talks and workshop around the globe. He's a great teammate and a highly passionate about his work."
