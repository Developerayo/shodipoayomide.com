CodeSandbox and Netlify are like a passanger and an uber driver, the passanger enters into the car and the uber driver starts the car and keeps on moving, CodeSandbox started with a super amazing idea by [Ives van Hoorne](https://twitter.com/CompuIves) the Creator of CodeSandbox and now works fulltime developing it.

# What is CodeSandbox

CodeSandbox is an online VSCode-like editor built for web applications development, It was built with a mindset to make projects sharing easy across teams and people. Get started with CodeSandbox here https://codesandbox.io.

# What is Netlify

Netlify is a developers platform that automates codes, built in a way users will be able to simply push their code and the platform handles the rest.


# Let's get started

Firstly, visit your https://codesandbox.io dashboard and create a simple static site from one of the client templates.

## List of client Templates on CodeSandbox
- React.js (create-react-app)
- Vue.js (vue-cli)
- Angular.js (angular-cli)
- Preact.js (preact-cli)
- Vanilla (parcel)
- Cx.js (cxjs)
- Dojo (dojo/cli-create-app)
- Reason (reason)
- Svelte (svelte)
- Static (static)

In this scenario we would be using the React create-react-app template.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554201857/csb01.png" width="600px"></p>

# File Structure

```
my-app/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
  src/
    index.js
    index.css
```
For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js is` the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

## File Structure Content

**src/index.js**

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import "./styles.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>CodeSandbox X Netlify</h2>
      <h3>Deploying Static Sites to Netlify from CodeSandbox.</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

**src/index.css**

```css
.App {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
```

**public/index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">
  <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json">
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
  <title>CodeSandbox X Netlify</title>
</head>
<body>
  <noscript>
    You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.
  </noscript>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

You can create other files inside the `src` folder for faster rebuilds because only files inside the `src` folder are processed by Webpack. You need to put any JavaScript and CSS files inside `src`, otherwise, Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Next, you would have to click on **file** and Fork the Sandbox, Awesome! Now you have it all to yourself. you can customize it whichever way you desire.

# Deploy to Netlify

<p align="center"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554202547/csb02.png" width="700px"></p>

Once that's done you should have something similar to what I have below.

<p align="center"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554240311/csb03.png" width="700px"></p>

Now, let's create our GitHub repository directly from our CodeSandbox dashboard, click on the GitHub icon on the icon tag across your left.

<p align="center"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554243397/csb04.png" width="700px"></p>

Put in your desired name of repo and then click **create repository**, you should get the below, but then wait a few seconds for it to deploy.

<p align="center"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554243397/csb04.png" width="700px"></p>

You should get a loading screen like the below for some seconds.

<p align="center"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554244125/csb05.png" width="700px"></p>

Once that's done, click on the Plus sign and refork the repo, Click again on the rocket button and click deploy on Netlify.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554244126/csb06.png" width="700px"></p>

Once deploy is clicked on Netlify, you will get a unique domain like csb-mqpoxl7wjx wait few seconds for it to build and deploy.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554244125/csb07.png" width="700px"></p>

AwesomeðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥, You should get two buttons **Visit** and **Claim Site** click **Visit** to view the deployed site.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554244125/csb08.png" width="700px"></p>

Your deployed site should look like the image below if all steps were followed.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554244125/csb09.png" width="700px"></p>

# Claim your site

Once deployed you would see a blue button named Claim Site click it,

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554583068/csb_claim.png" width="700px"></p>

Once that's clicked, you would be redirected to a new page on Netlify that looks like the image below, you just have to add it to your netlify dashboard.

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554583068/csb_claim2.png" width="700px"></p>

Your CodeSandbox site has successfully been added to the list of your site's hosted on Netlify

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1554583067/csb_claim3.png" width="700px"></p>
