TortoiseGit is a Git code control client, which is based on TortoiseSVN. It is an [open source](https://github.com/TortoiseGit/TortoiseGit) software under GNU license.

## Benefits of using Tortoisegit

* Tortoisegit makes it easier to clone a repository
* Tortoisegit makes it easier to upload your code from your laptop to your repository online easily with a single command line.
* Extremely easy to pull from your online repository to update your local if you are working on a collaboration project with the click of a button.
* This tool makes it easy to remove all un-tracked files from your local with the click of a button.
* And a lot more that can be found on the link below:

## How To connect TortoiseGit with Github

Once you have got that all opened, click on generate then move the mouse all around the box to make it go faster

After clicking on generate, you will have a box like this below

THE LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS BELOW

>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQE8o8FvUv1lCUBJe2hH6MG

Once you have this, save it in a secure file.

Do not forget you copied the link from GITHUB that has your project repository link, now lets put that in use:

`https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git`

Create a folder on desktop and name it. Mine is named Code, then create a file in the folder, Mine is named myproject. Create a text file named hi.txt and put some text in it.

lets move on to putting the github link to use

> Now you see the hi.txt file we created, in the message box put in initial commit then click ok.

Now lets go back to that created Repo on GITHUB

Remember the link you copied from github

> https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git

let us make use of that.

Right click on the folder you created mine is named ‘myproject’, then click on tortoisegit, followed by the push selection at the top of the list.
