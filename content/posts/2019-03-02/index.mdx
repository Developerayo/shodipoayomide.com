TortoiseGit is a Git code control client, which is based on TortoiseSVN. It is an [open source](https://github.com/TortoiseGit/TortoiseGit) software under GNU license.

## Benefits of using Tortoisegit

* Tortoisegit makes it easier to clone a repository
* Tortoisegit makes it easier to upload your code from your laptop to your repository online easily with a single command line.
* Extremely easy to pull from your online repository to update your local if you are working on a collaboration project with the click of a button.
* This tool makes it easy to remove all un-tracked files from your local with the click of a button.
* And a lot more that can be found on the link below:

## How To connect TortoiseGit with Github

</p>

Once you have got that all opened, click on generate then move the mouse all around the box to make it go faster

After clicking on generate, you will have a box like this below

THE LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS BELOW

> ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAq0jmbEdOeDHZBcD8o8FvUv1lCUBJJmM0DpHz+nn7SzT4CT2PHcOBken+9L2Zz9D7bopmx033DX3/kp/84m3Ea1n/bVDEDfWve2hH6MGcaMM3KVBhMB+6j9LVludG8zYAIt+vrDI/F9f2pZv27h9DznOT+0PJg4cpOkRSFJTgI3tY4cNTWr5kTZdBONEMI+QGNtpWwr774S

Once you have this, save it in a secure file.

Do not forget you copied the link from GITHUB that has your project repository link, now lets put that in use:

<mark style="background-color: #9a69c2; color: #fff;">https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git</mark>

Create a folder on desktop and name it. Mine is named Code, then create a file in the folder, Mine is named myproject. Create a text file named hi.txt and put some text in it.

lets move on to putting the github link to use

<p align="center">
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerayo/image/upload/v1551557113/6.png">
</p>

<small style="color: lightgrey;">Now you see the hi.txt file we created, in the message box put in initial commit then click ok
</small>

<p align="center">

</p>

Now lets go back to that created Repo on GITHUB

Remember the link you copied from github

<mark style="background-color: #9a69c2; color: #fff;">https://github.com/Developerayo/My-Project-testing-tortiseGIT-.git</mark>

let us make use of that.

Right click on the folder you created mine is named â€˜myprojectâ€™, then click on tortoisegit, followed by the push selection at the top of the list.
