When trying to move from one development environment to the other based on how we work as developers can be hard and stressful sometimes, thinking you would have to push to GitHub, merge the PR into master and get to use the GitHub URL to import the CodeSandbox repo into CodeSandbox by going to [https://codesandbox.io/s/github](https://codesandbox.io/s/github) can be a bit stressful if you are like me who loves to move very fast and works on both a MacBook Pro and an Ipad Pro.

## What is CodeSandbox

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) is an online code editor and prototyping tool similar to our local VScode that makes creating and sharing web apps faster and also improves coloration between teams and people.

## Creating a New React Project

Open your terminal and run the `create-react-app` command below, what this is going to do is, it would auto-generate a new repo called `codesandbox-deploy-cli` on top of `create-react-app`

```git
npx create-react-app codesandbox-deploy-cli
```

Once that is all set up, you would have to enter into the directory using the command below,

```git
cd codesandbox-deploy-cli
```

Now that you are in we can run the project in development and see a preview, start the project by running the command below,

```git
yarn start
```

Right after initialization, you should see a preview window like the below in your browser,

## Adding some changes

Now we have to make so minor text changes to our app, open the `app.js` folder inside the `src` directory and past the below changes

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
        Deploying to <b>CodeSandbox</b> Using the CodeSandbox CLI
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://CodeSandbox.io"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          What is CodeSandbox
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

## Deploying Via CodeSandbox CLI

We are done setting up this project and it's now time to deploy, before deploying to CodeSandbox you have to install the [CodeSandbox CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codesandbox-cli) itself from npm using the command below.

```git
npm i codesandbox-cli
```

We now have that installed, let's take a look next, on how to deploy directly to CodeSandbox via the codesandbox cli.

# Deploying Via CodeSandbox CLI

We got the cli installed as one of our `node-modules`, so now we can deploy, run the command below in your terminal to start the deployment.

```
codesandbox ./
```

For new users, you would get a link to CodeSandbox to copy a token and paste in your terminal to give you permissions on your terminal to deploy to codesandbox, you would also get this question that says `Are you sure you want to proceed with the deployment? (y/N)` your answer should be `yes`, then hit return for mac or enter for windows, a second after hitting the return key you should get another line which says `Uploading files to CodeSandbox` this would take a while depending on the size of your project.

Once deployed to CodeSanbox you get a link in your terminal linking you to the deployment on codesandbox.io, copy and paste into your browser, you should get a preview exactly what I have below

## Reviewing Deployment

Looking at the screenshot above you can notice the name of the repo we initialized using `npm create-react-app codesandbox-deploy-cli` was recalled here on CodeSandbox and not some random ID, also it showed who initialized the repo which is `developerayo` in this scenario, all these happened due to the token we copied from codesandbox into our terminal which is keeping our project terminal and codesandbox dashboard in sync

## Wrapping Up
Speed is one of the most important factors to consider while building apps.

> ## It's great to work hard but you get a bigger paycheck if you can work harder and smarter.

Pushing code directly from your local VScode to CodeSandbox via the CLI is amazing and I believe it's something people should learn to use often for productivity reasons.

Thanks to all the amazing people building CodeSandbox fulltime, YOU ROCK!
