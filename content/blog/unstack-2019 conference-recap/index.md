**unStack** is a hands-on workshop community, tailored towards building great technical talents with a hands-on learning approach, learning about new technologies/tools and mastering patterns to navigate already existing ones.

This event which was completely sold out with 260+ people in attendance, being the first offline event of unStack Community is not the first event nonetheless. The first-ever event of the unStack Community was a LIVE session on Zoom titled **The Future of GraphQL for the Web** with **Nadir Dabit(Developer Advocate at Amazon) & Shodipo Ayomide** as speakers.

The online zoom event impressive had 70+ developers tuned in LIVE into the event on zoom. The offline event was then conceived to accommodate folks in the Lagos Developer Ecosystem who could not tune into such LIVE sessions for reasons ranging from data to time and all.

Worthy of mention is the fact that some members of the team were super early birds that day who reached out and simply asked: “How can I be of help?”
